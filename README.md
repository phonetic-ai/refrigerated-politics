# Refrigerated Politics
AI for answering the question: Is it a Trump fridge or a Biden fridge?

## What is this?
Refigerated Politicsâ„¢ is the internet's premier source for AI-generated cold political takes.

## How Does It Work?
We combed through [the NYT's database](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/10/27/upshot/biden-trump-poll-quiz.html) of 429 fridge images (frimages) and lovingly forced our graphics card to do a neural architecture search until it found just the right one.

## But does it *really* work?
It has an accuracy of 61.17647290229797%. Mere mortals were only capable of scoring an average of 52%. In scientific terms, this AI is going to put you out of a job if your job is judging fridges.

## Who are you voting for?
I could tell you, but instead I'll let the AI do the talking.
